  bio: [
    'I have been engineering highly available, scalable, and real-time software and web applications with pixel-perfect user interfaces for over <strong>4 years</strong>. For the past 2 years, I have been developing web apps with engaging user experience and modern look-and-feel across multiple platforms (web/mobile) along with managing their infrastructural components and cloud-based services.',
    'Shortly after graduating from <a href="https://www.smu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Methodist University</a> with a Masters degree in Computer Science, I joined the engineering team at <a href="https://www.riversagile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rivers Agile</a> in 2019, where I worked as a software consultant on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects with multiple clients. After spending 2 years, I switched gears and joined <a href="https://www.highmarkhealth.org/hmk/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highmark Health</a> as a full-stack software engineer in 2021.',
    'Outside of work, I like to spend my time working on side-projects and playing video games. I also enjoy solving coding problems that involve great analytical thinking and challenge me intellectually at every step. I am an explorer, and tend to constantly look for new things to learn and build.',
